# LSTub

In the practice of LsTub, we have the task of making a Java program, programmed from IntelliJ. This program has to be capable of searching videos in YouTube, saving favorite ones, classify the search to show the videos with more likes , show the statistics of the favorite videos, create a mosaic of the favorite videos, and finally show the playlists in an html file.
To obtain the information of the videos, we will have to use the Google webservice (API), which will allow us to access the information of the video that we need.
